1. What exactly is []?
Ans:-
[] this is a lis in python contains element saprated by comma(,) and enclosed in squre bracket.They can store any type of data like -string, interger and other lists.

2. In a list of values stored in a variable called spam, how would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value? (Assume [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] are in spam.)
Ans:-
To assign hello as third value in list [2,4,6,8,10], we can use code as below.

spam=[2,4,6,8,10]
spam[2]="hello"
print(spam)

and output of above code will be [2, 4, 'hello', 8, 10] , and it contains hello as third value in list.

3. What is the value of spam[int(int('3' * 2) / 11)]?
Ans:-
8

4. What is the value of spam[-1]?
Ans:-
 20
  
5. What is the value of spam[:2]?
Ans:-
[2,4]

6. What is the value of bacon.index('cat')?
Ans:- 1

7. How does bacon.append(99) change the look of the list value in bacon?
Ans:-
When we runs the code code bacon.append(99) insert 99 in list and output looks as below .
[3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99, 99, 99]
here i executed the code three times so 99 appended three times.


8. How does bacon.remove('cat') change the look of the list in bacon?
Ans:-
When we runs code - bacon.remove('cat'), this code removes 'cat' from the list, results are as below:-
[3.14, 11, True, 99, 99, 99]


9. What are the list concatenation and list replication operators?
Ans:-
In python , list concatination oprater is '+', and list replication oprator is '*'
'+' this used to concotaniate two lists and '*' used to replicate two or multiple lists.

10. What is difference between the list methods append() and insert()?
Ans:-
In python , append and insert oprators used to insert element in list .
append used to add element in end of element while insert add element on specific index.

11. What are the two methods for removing items from a list?
Ans:-
there are two oprators for removing element from list are 'remove' & 'pop'
'remove' removes element from a specific indexes while 'pop' removes elements from end of list.

12. Describe how list values and string values are identical.
Ans:-
List values can have any types of data like strind , integer, list itself, etc., while string always contants letter.

  13. What's the difference between tuples and lists?
  Ans:-
  Both are used to store collection of values but they have some key diferences like :-
  mutiablity- list are mutable like we can add , remove or change values from list while tuple do not have access to the all of these .
  There are many build in function for list like - remove , append , short etc , while tuple have no build in function for these.
  
  14. How do you type a tuple value that only contains the integer 42?
  A tuple in python can be define by using parenthless () contains values in it using comma to saprate values
 as like:-
 
 t=(42,)

Here we used comma after 42 to represent that this is tuple.

15. How do you get a list value's tuple form? How do you get a tuple value's list form?
Ans:- python can conver from list to tuple or tuple to list as follows.

List to tuple:-

list=[1,3,4,6,'rajendra',False]
tuple1=tuple(list)
tuple1

by running above code we converted a list into tuple and output is- (1, 3, 4, 6, 'rajendra', False).

Tuple to list:-
t=(1,3,5,7,9,'rajendra')
list1=list(t)
list

by excuting above code , we converted a tuple in a list and output is - [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 'rajendra'].

16. Variables that "contain" list values are not necessarily lists themselves. Instead, what do they contain?
Ans:- variable in python used to refer the data , they do not contain the actual data to them , valiable only refers to list , and list
contains that data or value.

17. How do you distinguish between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?
Ans:- there are two types of copying methods in python like copy.copy()- this is swallow copy methods that keeps eddecting original copy , while you are making
any changes in duplicate copy .
While copy.deepcopy() make copy and changes does not affect original copy , beacuse duplicate copy will be assigned on another memory in python.
